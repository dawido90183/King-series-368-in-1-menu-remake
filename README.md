i used to look up to all of you. you were so good at sonic rom hacking. but your
personalities are garbage. accusing me of trolling when i gave a wholehearted attempt
at making the sonic 1 disassembly better. i 'm SORRY if they aren't up to your overly
high standards, but you didn't have to be so rude to me. in fact you couldve just fixed
whatever possible mistakes i made, but no! you decided to just call me a troll and accuse me
of exploting invalid machine code or something. what the hell! that is so insulting to me.
and how DARE you call my efforts a "shitpost". clownacy, you sure are some clown. i thought
you and flamewing were amazing rom hackers. clownacy, i saw your elemental shields video
and i was blown away by how quickly you could do it. flamewing, sonic classic heroes was a 
really cool hack idea. i thought you would all be cool people. i was wrong. YOU guys are the
real trolls here. we need better people doing the rom hacking now. you will all be obsolete soon.
don't you forget it. my future hacks will blow all of yours out of the water and i'll
be the ultimate rom hacker (besides markey jester).

you will all see...
